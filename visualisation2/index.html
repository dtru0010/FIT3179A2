                        With the complexities and dynamic growth of the Australian Energy Market system and its overall goals, it is important to highlight, analyse and review the production, distribution, and consumption of fuels. 
                        As such, with recent trends, the market has been prioritizing the Net Zero Plan which aims to decarbonize the economy providing improvements in energy efficiency and reduced greenhouse gas emissions. 
                        Additionally, it is important to compare the global differences to explore the approaches in energy challenges to inspire best practices and innovations to improve the overall system.

                        In the Australian landscape, <span class="coal">black coal</span> is the leading fuel type being supplied as energy throughout history.
                        This correlates to how Australia falls under the top 5 countries in coal production.
                        However, with the economic shifts towards <span class="renewables">renewable</span> energy, as seen in the steady growth of <span class="renewables">renewable</span> energy production, <span class="coal">black coal</span> is beginning to see an accelerated decline to reach decarbonization.
                        Interestingly, <span class="gas">natural gas</span> has seen a increasing shift in production due to the improvements of technology allowing for economic extraction from places that were disadvantageous.

                        On the other hand, Australia overall is predominantly reliant on <span class="oil">oil</span> and <span class="coal">coal</span> for energy consumption.
                        Yet, with the decreasing demand of <span class="coal">coal</span> extraction and the reliancy of <span class="renewables">renewables</span>, <span class="coal">coal</span> and <span class="renewables">renewables</span> have an inverse correlation.
                        With New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland being the highest consumers of <span class="coal">coal</span>, Tasmania has been net zero, consuming mainly <span class="renewables">renewables</span> as a result of their investment towards hydroelectric power systems.
                        Lacking <span class="coal">coal</span> reserves, Northern Territory is heavily reliant on <span class="gas">gas</span> to supply their needs due to their abundance of gas resources.

                        It is important to understand the distribution flow of energy as it assists in seeking efficiency issues, creating knowledge towards improving the sustainability of sources, improving the economic planning for energy needs and costs, and assessing and mitigating any environmental impact in relation to the flow from production to destination.
                        Australia is known to be a major asset in the global energy market due to their leading exports in <span class="coal">coal</span> and one of the top exports in <span class="gas">gas</span> as a result of their abundance of resources, placing 72% of their total resources towards exports.

                        Working towards achieve the decarbonization of Australia, tracking the emission projection allows to analyse the progression so that proper measures can be made to stay on track with reaching the 2050 target.
                        In tracking, there are two scenarios that are explored.
                        The <span class="baseline">baseline</span> scenario refers to the current policies and measures that are currently inplace, whereas <span class="additional">with additional measures</span> scenario builds upon the <span class="baseline">baseline</span> showing the impacts with the inclusion of policies that have been announced but are in the design and consultation phase.

                        Australia's Energy Mix refers to the contributions of each fuel type to the consumption. Once dominated by fossil fuels like <span class="coal">coal</span> and <span class="gas">gas</span>, the landscape is beginning to shift towards <span class="renewables">renewable</span> sources.
                        As such, with the goal of doubling the emission reductions by 2030, the overall goal of being net zero by 2050 means the reliance of 82% of our energy mix to be in <span class="renewables">renewable</span> energy.
                        The exponential growth in renewables and rapid decline in <span class="coal">coal</span> has lead to 34% of our energy mix to be renewable and a deduction of coal by 36.89% from 2001 to 2023.

                        Across the world, it is improtant to view how the share of energy consumption in each country comes from certain fuels. This provides insight into the contributions of energy reliance in each country and how the growth of each fuel has occured over time, exploring the sustainability and security of its energy system. 
                        Additionally, it will help assess the economic and environmental trade-offs that each country may face or reveal technological and policy insights as the energy mix can reflect the effectiveness.
                        Overall, the differences assist in identifying trends, shifts in demand, and reveal the role of various fuels in shaping the global energy market.
